          <h3>The Journey Begins</h3>
          <p>
            Born and raised in Ibadan, Nigeria, DJ03 (born into the Iyiola family) is the youngest of three brothers. 
            Growing up in a family of three, with two older brothers ahead of him, DJ03 learned early on the value of 
            hard work, dedication, and carving his own path. His roots in Ibadan—a city known for its rich cultural 
            heritage and vibrant music scene—shaped his musical foundation and instilled in him a deep appreciation 
            for authentic African sounds.
